     <b>Calculas</b>,branch of Mathematics,developed by<b><i>Newton and Leibinz</i></b>, deals with the study of the rate of change. Calculusdefine formula like
        f(2)<sup>n</sup><abbr title ="centi meter">CM</abbr>is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions.<i>it helps us to understend the changes between values which are related by a function. Calculus Math mainly focused on some importent topics such as <b>differentiation,integration,limits,function</b></i>and 
        so on Scientific Calculation provide formilas like : H<sub>2</sub>SO<SUB>4</SUB>
